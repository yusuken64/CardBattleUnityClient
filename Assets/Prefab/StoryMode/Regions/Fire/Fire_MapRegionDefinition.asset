  Description: In the far reaches of the world, a volcanic mountain burns day and
    night, its slopes split by rivers of lava and echoing caverns. Powerful dragons
    rule the molten peaks, stirring ash storms with their wings. Beneath the surface,
    fearless dwarves mine rare metals and forge deadly weapons in magma-lit forges,
    treasures as feared as they are coveted.
